# SDDObench: A Benchmark for Streaming Data-Driven Optimization with Concept Drift  

SDDObench is the first benchmark tailored for evaluating and comparing the streaming data-driven evolutionary algorithms  (SDDEAs). SDDObench comprises two sets of objective functions combined with five different types of concept drifts, which offer the benefit of being inclusive in generating data streams that mimic various real-world situations, while also facilitating straightforward description and analysis.
